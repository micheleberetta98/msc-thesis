(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Nowadays, web applications' needs are more sophisticated and demanding, such as 3D visualisation, audio and video,
real-time features, and so on. Efficiency and security are then important points that must be addressed. However JavaScript,
as the de facto standard language on the web, is not able to meet these requirements.

In order to compensate for JavaScript's lack of performance, WebAssembly was introduced -
it is a new language that is ``designed for efficient execution and compact representation of code
on modern processors including in a web browser'' \cite{wasm-w3c-announcement}, and strives to improve
both performance and power consumption.
