I would like to express my deepest thanks to Professor Stefano Paraboschi, without whom
this endeavour would not have been possible.
Additionally, I am extremely grateful to all the PhD students in the \textit{Seclab} group,
who have followed and helped me during all phases of this work, from the research on
the existing technologies to the development of the project and redaction of this thesis.

I am also very grateful to my close friends and classmates who stayed by my side
for all these years, sharing all hardships and joyful moments.
This has been a long journey, and I would not be here as the person I am now
without their support.
I would also be remiss in not mentioning my family for their aid throughout the years.

Lastly, a thank to all the many people that saw in me much more than what I saw in myself.
